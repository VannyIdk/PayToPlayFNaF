            Golden Freddy/Yellow bear - is a golden version of Freddy, while theres not much information we know about, he is a very important part of the lore and is the one who murdered the Phone Guy according to theories. He appears on 6-th night and crashes the game if encountered and ignored. He is the only one in the game without a animated jumpscare and many people think he or they have 2 souls, Crying Child and Cassidy. Earlier somewhere in 2014-2015 people were saying he is the one who commited the bite of 87 as if in the 6-th night mode if you put 1987 - his jumpscare will appear and crash the game. As the lore was changing Scott Cawton said that now it was a wrong guess and he made the bite of 83. Although everything can happen. So for now we'll just let it be what it is because otherwise we'll accidently touch the lore of FNaF 2, 3, 4, etc.     </p>
